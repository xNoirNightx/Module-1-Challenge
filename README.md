## Description

I was tasked with my first challenge to edit the coding of the this web application.

- I collected as much information as possible from W3school and youtube to assist me on completing this challenge.
- I was able to problem solve and fix code.
- I learned how to correctly use Semantic Elements.
- I learned how to clean up HTML and CSS code to the best of my ability. 

I followed the criteria below provided by the class instructors.

## User Story

- AS A marketing agency
- I WANT a codebase that follows accessibility standards
- SO THAT our own site is optimized for search engines


## Acceptance Criteria

- GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards
- WHEN I view the source code
- THEN I find semantic HTML elements
- WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements
- THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
- WHEN I view the icon and image elements
- THEN I find accessible alt attributes
- WHEN I view the heading attributes
- THEN they fall in sequential order
- WHEN I view the title element
- THEN I find a concise, descriptive title

I feel as I have accoplished the task set for me and look forward to the next one.
